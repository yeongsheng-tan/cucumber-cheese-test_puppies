Feature: Making Cheese

    As a cheese maker
    I want to make cheese
    So I can share my cheesiness

Scenario Outline: Using the cheese machine
        Given I have no cheese
        When I press the make "<type>" cheese button
        Then I should see the "<message>" message

            | type      | message               |
            | Swiss     | I love Swiss cheese   |
